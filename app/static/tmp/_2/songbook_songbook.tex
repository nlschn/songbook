So excuse me forgetting,  but these things I do\\
Am               Am/G              Am/F\#             Fmaj7\\
You see I've forgotten if they're green or they're blue\\
C                  G                  E         Am\\
Anyway, the thing is, what I really mean\\
C               Dm7        F              C\\
Yours are the sweetest eyes I've ever seen\\

That I put down in words,\\
