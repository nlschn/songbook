I don't wanna talk\\

About things we've gone through\\

Though it's hurting me\\

Now it's history\\
               C\\
I've played all my cards\\
                       G/B\\
And that's what you've done too\\
                Dm/A\\
Nothing more to say\\

No more ace to play\\

That's her destiny\\

I was in your arms\\
Thinking I belonged there\\
I figured it made sense\\
Building me a fence\\
Building me a home\\
Thinking I'd be strong there\\
But I was a fool\\
Playing by the rules\\

The gods may throw a dice\\
Their minds as cold as ice\\
And someone way down here\\
Loses someone dear\\
The winner takes it all\\
The loser has to fall\\
It's simple and it's plain\\
Why should I complain?\\

But tell me does she kiss\\
Like I used to kiss you?\\
Does it feel the same\\
When she calls your name? \\
Somewhere deep inside\\
You must know I miss you\\
But what can I say\\
Rules must be obeyed\\

The judges will decide\\
The likes of me abide\\
Spectators of the show\\
Always staying low\\
The game is on again\\
A lover or a friend\\
A big thing or a small\\
The winner takes it all\\

I don't wanna talk\\
If it makes you feel sad\\
And I understand\\
You've come to shake my hand\\
I apologize\\
If it makes you feel bad\\
Seeing me so tense\\
No self-confidence, but you see \\

The winner takes it all ...\\
C          E7 Am        Am A/C\#\\
 So the winner takes it a -all\\
Dm            G\\
 And the loser has to fall\\
C           E7  Am       Am A/C\#\\
 Throw a di-ice, cold as ice\\
Dm             G\\
 Way down here, someone dear\\
C           E7  Am      Am  A/C\#\\
 Takes it a-all, has to fall\\
Dm                     G\\
 It seems plain to me ...\\
